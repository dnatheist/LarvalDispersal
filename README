This project is code in Knitr and r files to analyse data regarding Murray cod larval drift in the upper Murrumbidgee river in 2013. Hopefully the code is easily extensible to other years data, and additional data.

The data come out of the MS access database originally and is a csv paste of the qslLarvaeAgePlus query.
There are some other data files as well.

Chemistry data from the Laser ablation mass spectrometry.
Carbon and Nitrogen Isotope delta data.
Genetic data from DArT sequencing.

A few lists also include 'names' of clades and groupings of the 6 sites along the river. Each is required for some part of the analysis. 

There is a Tableau folder which contains a Tableau workbook and a number of r outputs for subsequent analysis in Tableau. This is because Tableau does good graphics and specifically can do paged or animated plotting which is useful for some things.

Reports from Knitr wind up by unchangeable default in the src folder so get moved to the Reports folder manually. There are some other outputs from r that wind up in there as well although I might remove them as they are really data files and usually for Tableau or some other external app.
