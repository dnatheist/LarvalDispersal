1. Redesign data from scratch. At present there are too many interdependencies from one code chunk to another. Sort out should it be in initial munge or not?

2. Make code chunks stand alone.
3. Include libraries in chunks - not all up front in knitr
4. save outputs for reuse easily (at present I have to run whole knitr thing each time.)
5. Consider use of cache for time intensive things (like Iterated mantel) 
6. Need to tidy up (remove spent variables) at end of each .r file or Knitr chunk. (Or save them specifically if required)
